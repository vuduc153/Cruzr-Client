Location (100, 100, 0.2)
A: "Morning! Did you get a chance to look over the figures I sent yesterday?"
B: "Hi! Yes, I did. Your projections are solid, but I think we need to double-check the data source for Q2. It seems a bit off."
=== CONSTRAINT ===
[%CONSTRAINT%]
Answer:
It can’t be deducted from the conversation that any of the people will be going anywhere after this, so the answer will be an empty list [].

=== PAST DIALOGUE ===
Location (100, 100, 0.2)
A: "Morning! Did you get a chance to look over the figures I sent yesterday?"
B: "Hi! Yes, I did. Your projections are solid, but I think we need to double-check the data source for Q2. It seems a bit off."
=== CURRENT DIALOGUE ===
Location (100, 100, 0.2)
A: "Good point. How about we go pull out the original reports? It's the best way to verify the numbers."
B: "Agreed. Let's head there. We might find more insights with the raw data in hand."
A: "Perfect. I'll go grab the keys to the archives. Last time, some of the files were mislabeled, so it might take a bit of digging."

Answer:
Both A and B will go get the reports in the archives at [170, 120, 0] after this; but before that, A will have to go to get the keys to the archives at [220, 180, 0]. So the answer will be:
[{
	"actor": A,
	"target": {
		"label": "keys",
		"coordinate": [220, 180, 0],
		"additional_detail": "key to the archives"
	}
}, 
{
	"actor": A,
	"target": {
		"label": "reports",
		"coordinate": [170, 120, 0],
		"additional_detail": ""
	}
},
{
	"actor": B,
	"target": {
		"label": "reports",
		"coordinate": [170, 120, 0],
		"additional_detail": ""
	}
}]

B: "The numbers are matching up. Looks like our initial analysis was correct. This is a relief."
A: "Great work! I'll stay here a bit longer to reorganize these files for next time. Could you take the verified reports back up?"
B: "Sure thing. I will put the keys back when I’m at it. See you back upstairs.”

Answer:
The two people were originally at [100, 100, 0.2], and B will be returning there, but not before returning the keys to their original location at [220, 180, 0]. A will stay in the new location, so the answer will be 
[{
	"actor": B,
	"target": {
		"label": "keys",
		"coordinate": [220, 180, 0],
		"additional_detail": "key to the archives"
	}
}, 
{
	"actor": B,
	"target": {
		"label": "",
		"coordinate": [100, 100, 0.2],
		"additional_detail": ""
	}
